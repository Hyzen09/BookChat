export const text = "When I was thirteen years old, my father died. He’d developed lung cancer\r\nin his fifties, which left him bedridden for a year before it finally killed him.\r\nHe was a humble and decent man, who encouraged me to think more\r\ndeeply about life.\r\nI was totally unprepared for his death, and I coped with it badly. I\r\nbecame angry and depressed. I’d stay out all night, playing cat and mouse\r\nwith the local cops, breaking into buildings and waiting for them to arrive\r\nso I could run into gardens and dive over hedges and fences to lose them. I\r\nwas always in trouble, either for skipping lessons at school, arguing with\r\nmy teachers, or getting in fights with my classmates. As soon as my\r\nsixteenth birthday came around, I was marched briskly down to the\r\nheadmaster’s office and given two choices: either leave voluntarily or be\r\nexpelled. So I left, and I was subsequently placed in a special program for\r\ntroubled kids. I felt that my life was spiraling rapidly out of control. I’d\r\nbeen labeled a “write-off” by school and social services. I didn’t really see\r\nany point trying to prove them wrong.\r\nEach evening my father would come home from his work as a digger\r\ndriver on building sites and collapse exhausted in an armchair, hands\r\ncovered in grease and dirt. The job didn’t pay well, and he hadn’t two\r\npennies to rub together, but he never complained. When he was a young\r\nman, his best friend had passed away, leaving my father a farm in his will,\r\nto everyone’s surprise. He refused the bequest, returning the land to the\r\nother man’s family. He used to say, “Money won’t bring you happiness,”\r\nand he really believed that. He showed me that there are more important\r\nthings in life and that true wealth comes from being contented with\r\nwhatever you have rather than desiring to have more and more.\r\nAfter my father’s funeral, my mother placed his old leather wallet on the\r\ndining room table and told me to take it. I opened it slowly; I think my\r\nhands were shaking but I’m not sure why. Inside there was nothing except a\r\nbadly worn scrap of paper. It turned out to be a passage he’d torn from the\r\nBook of Exodus: “And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he\r\nsaid, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto\r\nyou.” I was desperate to understand what on earth those words could\r\npossibly have meant to him. My own philosophical journey began precisely\r\nat that moment, as I stood there perplexed, with that piece of paper in my\r\nhand.\r\nWhen I learned many years later that Marcus Aurelius had lost his father\r\nat an early age, I wondered if he’d been left searching in the same way I had\r\nfor a sense of direction. After my father’s death, I was left with religious\r\nand philosophical questions that troubled me very deeply. I remember being\r\nterrified of dying. I would lie in bed at night unable to sleep, trying to solve\r\nthe riddle of existence and find some consolation. It was as though I had an\r\nitch at the back of my brain that I needed to scratch but couldn’t quite reach.\r\nI didn’t know it at the time, but that sort of existential anxiety is a common\r\nexperience that drives people to the study of philosophy. The philosopher\r\nSpinoza, for example, wrote:\r\nI thus perceived that I was in a state of great peril, and I compelled myself to seek with all my\r\nstrength for a remedy, however uncertain it might be; as a sick man struggling with a deadly\r\ndisease, when he sees that death will surely be upon him unless a remedy be found, is\r\ncompelled to seek such a remedy with all his strength, inasmuch as his whole hope lies\r\ntherein.1\r\nI took the phrase “I am that I am” to refer to the pure awareness of\r\nexistence itself, which at first seemed like something deeply mystical or\r\nmetaphysical to me: “I am the consciousness of my own existence.” It\r\nreminded me of the famous inscription from the Delphic Oracle’s shrine:\r\nKnow Thyself. That became one of my maxims. I grew quite obsessed with\r\nthe pursuit of self-knowledge, through meditation and all forms of\r\ncontemplative exercises.\r\nI found out later that the passage my father carried with him all those\r\nyears plays an important role in the rites of a Masonic chapter called the\r\n“Royal Arch.” During initiation the candidate is asked, “Are you a Royal\r\nArch Mason?” to which he replies, “I—AM—THAT—I—AM.”\r\nFreemasonry has a long history in Scotland, going back at least four\r\ncenturies, and it has deep roots in my hometown of Ayr. My father and\r\nmany of my friends’ fathers were members of the local lodge. Most\r\nFreemasons are Christians, but they employ nondenominational language,\r\nreferring to God as “the Great Architect of the Universe.” According to the\r\nlegend presented in some of their texts, a set of spiritual teachings\r\noriginating with the builders of King Solomon’s temple was brought to the\r\nWest by the philosopher Pythagoras and further disseminated by Plato and\r\nEuclid. This ancient wisdom was reputedly handed down through the\r\ncenturies by medieval Masonic lodges. They used esoteric rituals,\r\ngeometric symbols such as the square, and compasses to convey their\r\nspiritual doctrines. Freemasonry also celebrates the four cardinal virtues of\r\nGreek philosophy, which correspond symbolically with the four corners of\r\nthe lodge: Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance. (Wisdom, justice,\r\ncourage, and moderation, if you prefer more modern terms.) My father took\r\nthese ethical teachings seriously, and they shaped his character in a way that\r\nleft a lasting impression on me. Freemasonry, at least for sincere\r\npractitioners like my father, didn’t represent the bookish sort of philosophy\r\ntaught in the ivory towers of universities, but rather something derived from\r\na much older conception of Western philosophy as a spiritual way of life.\r\nAs it happened, I wasn’t old enough to become a Freemason, and with\r\nmy reputation around town I wouldn’t have been invited to join anyway. So,\r\nwith negligible formal education behind me, I began reading everything I\r\ncould about philosophy and religion. I’m not sure I would have even been\r\nable to articulate exactly what I was looking for at that time, except that it\r\nwould have to somehow combine my interests in philosophy, meditation,\r\nand psychotherapy. I needed a more rational, philosophical guide to life, but\r\nnothing seemed to fit the bill. Then I had the good fortune to encounter\r\nSocrates.\r\nI had been studying the collection of ancient Gnostic texts discovered at\r\nNag Hammadi in Egypt, which are inflected with Greek philosophy. This\r\nled me to begin reading the Platonic dialogues, which portray Socrates, the\r\nquintessential Greek philosopher, questioning his friends and other\r\ninterlocutors about their deepest values. He tended to focus on the cardinal\r\nvirtues of Greek philosophy, later adopted by Freemasons. Socrates didn’t\r\nwrite any books on philosophy—we know about him only through the\r\nworks of others, mainly dialogues written by two of his most famous\r\nstudents, Plato and Xenophon. According to legend, Socrates was the first\r\nperson to apply the philosophical method to ethical questions. He\r\nparticularly wanted to help others to live wisely, in accord with reason. For\r\nSocrates, philosophy was not only a moral guide but also a kind of\r\npsychological therapy. Doing philosophy, he said, can help us overcome\r\nour fear of death, improve our character, and even find a genuine sense of\r\nfulfillment.\r\nThe Socratic dialogues are often notoriously inconclusive. Indeed,\r\nSocrates’s insistence that he knew that he knew nothing about certain\r\nmatters, referred to as “Socratic irony,” later inspired the tradition known as\r\nGreek Skepticism. Nevertheless, he appears to have communicated positive\r\nteachings to his students about the best way to live. The cornerstone of\r\nthese is captured in a famous passage from Plato’s Apology. Socrates faces\r\nthe trumped-up charges of impiety and corrupting the youth, which would\r\nlead to his execution. Rather than apologize, though, or plead for mercy and\r\nparade his weeping wife and children before the jury as others did, he just\r\ncarries on doing philosophy by questioning his accusers and lecturing the\r\njury on ethics. At one point, he explains in plain language what it means to\r\nhim to be a philosopher:\r\nFor I go around doing nothing but persuading both young and old among you not to care for\r\nyour body or your wealth in preference to or as strongly as for the best possible state of your\r\nsoul, as I say to you: “Wealth does not bring about virtue, but virtue makes wealth and\r\neverything else good for men, both individually and collectively.”2\r\nThat’s how he lived his life, and his students sought to emulate that\r\nexample. We are to place more importance upon wisdom and virtue than\r\nanything else. A “philosopher,” in Socrates’s sense, is therefore a person\r\nwho lives according to these values: someone who literally loves wisdom,\r\nthe original meaning of the word.\r\nLooking back, I realize that I turned to Socrates and other ancient\r\nphilosophers to find a philosophy of life like the one my father had found in\r\nFreemasonry. However, as mentioned earlier, the surviving dialogues\r\ntypically portray Socrates’s method of questioning rather than providing a\r\ndetailed practical account of the Socratic art of living wisely.\r\nWhile the ancient philosophers didn’t provide me with the practical\r\nanswers I was looking for back then, they did inspire me to read further. My\r\nnewfound sense of purpose also helped me to get my life back on track: I\r\nstopped getting in trouble and enrolled to study philosophy at university, in\r\nAberdeen. I noticed, though, that something wasn’t right—the way we\r\napproached the subject was too academic and theoretical. The more time I\r\nspent in the basement of the library poring over books, the further away I\r\nseemed to be drifting from Socrates’s original conception of philosophy as a\r\nway of life, something that could improve our character and help us\r\nflourish. If ancient philosophers were veritable warriors of the mind, their\r\nmodern counterparts had become more like librarians of the mind, more\r\ninterested in collating and organizing ideas than putting philosophy to work\r\non a daily basis as a psychological practice.\r\nUpon graduating, I began studying and training in psychotherapy\r\nbecause learning to help others seemed to offer me a route to selfimprovement that I could relate to my studies in philosophy. It was a time\r\nof transition for the therapy field: Freudian and Jungian psychoanalytic\r\napproaches were slowly giving way to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT),\r\nwhich has since become the dominant form of evidence-based practice in\r\npsychotherapy. CBT was closer to the philosophical practice I was looking\r\nfor because it encourages us to apply reason to our emotions. However, it’s\r\nsomething you typically do for a few months and then set aside. It certainly\r\ndoesn’t aim to provide us with a whole way of life.\r\nModern therapy is necessarily more modest in scope than the ancient\r\nSocratic art of living—most of us these days are looking for a quick\r\nsolution to our mental health problems. Nevertheless, once I started\r\nworking as a psychotherapist, it became evident to me that most of my\r\nclients who suffered from anxiety or depression benefited from the\r\nrealization that their distress was due to their underlying values. Everyone\r\nknows that when we believe very strongly that something very bad has\r\nhappened, we typically become upset as a result. Likewise, if we believe\r\nthat something is very good and desirable, we become anxious when it’s\r\nthreatened or sad if it has already been lost. For example, in order to feel\r\nsocial anxiety, you have to believe that other people’s negative opinions of\r\nyou are worth getting upset about, that it’s really bad if they dislike you and\r\nreally important to win their approval. Even people who suffer from severe\r\nsocial anxiety disorder (social phobia) tend to feel “normal” when speaking\r\nto children or to their close friends about trivial matters, with a few\r\nexceptions. Nevertheless, they feel highly anxious when talking to people\r\nthey think are very important about subjects they think are very important.\r\nIf your fundamental worldview, by contrast, assumes that your status in the\r\neyes of others is of negligible importance, then it follows that you should be\r\nbeyond the reach of social anxiety.\r\nAnyone, I reasoned, who could adopt a healthier and more rational set of\r\ncore values, with greater indifference toward the things most of us worry\r\nabout in life, should be able to become much more emotionally resilient. I\r\njust couldn’t figure out how to combine the philosophy and values of\r\nSocrates with something like the therapeutic tools of CBT. Around that\r\ntime, though, as I was training in counseling and psychotherapy, everything\r\nchanged for me because I suddenly discovered Stoicism.\r\nThe potential value of Stoicism struck me immediately when I stumbled\r\nacross the French scholar Pierre Hadot’s What Is Ancient Philosophy?\r\n(1998) and Philosophy as a Way of Life (2004). As the latter title implies,\r\nHadot explored in depth the idea that ancient Western philosophers did in\r\nfact approach philosophy as a way of life. My eyes were opened to a whole\r\ntreasure trove of spiritual practices, tucked away in the literature of Greek\r\nand Roman philosophy, which were clearly designed to help people\r\novercome emotional suffering and develop strength of character. Hadot\r\ndiscovered that contemplative practices became very common in the\r\nphilosophical schools of the Hellenistic period, a few generations after the\r\ndeath of Socrates. The Stoic school in particular focused on the practical\r\nside of Socratic philosophy, not only through the development of virtues\r\nsuch as self-discipline and courage (what we might call emotional\r\nresilience) but also through extensive use of psychological exercises.\r\nSomething puzzled me, though. Hadot compared these philosophical\r\npractices to early Christian spiritual exercises. As a psychotherapist, I\r\nspotted immediately that most of the philosophical or spiritual exercises he\r\nidentified could be compared to psychological exercises found in modern\r\npsychotherapy. It very soon became evident to me that Stoicism was, in\r\nfact, the school of ancient Western philosophy with the most explicitly\r\ntherapeutic orientation and the largest armamentarium, or toolbox, of\r\npsychological techniques at its disposal. After scouring books on\r\nphilosophy for over a decade, I realized that I’d been looking everywhere\r\nexcept in the right place. “The stone the builders rejected has become the\r\ncornerstone” (118th Psalm).\r\nAs I began to devour the literature on Stoicism, I noticed that the form of\r\nmodern psychotherapy most akin to it was rational emotive behavior\r\ntherapy (REBT), the main precursor to CBT, first developed by Albert Ellis\r\nin the 1950s. Ellis and Aaron T. Beck, the other main pioneer of CBT, had\r\nboth cited Stoic philosophy as the inspiration for their respective\r\napproaches. For instance, Beck and his colleagues had written in The\r\nCognitive Therapy of Depression, “The philosophical origins of cognitive\r\ntherapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers.”3 Indeed, CBT and\r\nStoicism have some fundamental psychological assumptions in common,\r\nparticularly the “cognitive theory of emotion,” which holds that our\r\nemotions are mainly determined by our beliefs. Anxiety largely consists of\r\nthe belief, for example, that “something bad is going to happen,” according\r\nto Beck. From shared premises, moreover, Stoicism and CBT were bound\r\nto arrive at similar conclusions about what sort of psychological techniques\r\nmight be helpful to people suffering from anxiety, anger, depression, and\r\nother problems.\r\nOne Stoic technique particularly caught my attention. Although it’s well\r\nattested in the ancient sources, there’s very little mention of anything like\r\nthe “view from above”—as Hadot called it—in modern psychotherapy or\r\nself-help literature. It involves picturing events as though seen from high\r\noverhead, as they might be seen by the gods atop Mount Olympus, perhaps.\r\nBroadening our perspective often induces a sense of emotional equanimity.\r\nAs I practiced it myself, I noticed, as Hadot did, that it brings together a\r\nconfluence of themes central to ancient philosophy in a single vision. I also\r\nfound that it was easy to turn it into a guided meditation script. As I was\r\nnow training psychotherapists myself and speaking at conferences, I was\r\nable to guide rooms full of experienced therapists and trainees, up to a\r\nhundred at a time, through my version of the exercise. I was pleasantly\r\nsurprised to discover that they took to it instantly, and it became one of their\r\nfavorite exercises. They would describe how they were able to remain\r\nexceptionally calm while contemplating their situation in life from a\r\ndetached perspective. I began sharing my resources online via my personal\r\nblog.\r\nIn America, the marketer and entrepreneur Ryan Holiday embraced\r\nStoicism in The Obstacle Is the Way (2014) and The Daily Stoic (2016,\r\ncoauthored with Stephen Hanselman). In the UK, the illusionist and\r\ntelevision celebrity Derren Brown later published a book called Happy\r\n(2017), which drew inspiration from the Stoics. These authors were\r\nreaching a whole new audience far beyond academia and introducing it to\r\nStoicism as a form of self-help and a philosophy of life. The scientific\r\nskeptic and professor of philosophy Massimo Pigliucci published How to\r\nBe a Stoic in 2017. In the same year, Republican politician Pat McGeehan\r\nreleased Stoicism and the Statehouse. Stoicism was also being used in the\r\nmilitary, as part of Colonel Thomas Jarrett’s Warrior Resilience Training.\r\nThe NFL executive and former New England Patriots coach Michael\r\nLombardi embraced it, and the philosophy began to gain more and more\r\nadherents from the world of sports. Stoicism was clearly experiencing a\r\nresurgence in popularity, and this was just the tip of the iceberg. Online\r\ncommunities for Stoics were flourishing, attracting hundreds of thousands\r\nof members across the internet.\r\nTELLING THE STORY OF STOICISM\r\nA few years ago, when my daughter Poppy was four, she began asking me\r\nto tell her stories. I didn’t know any children’s stories, so I told her what\r\ncame to mind: Greek myths, stories about heroes and philosophers. One of\r\nher favorites was about the Greek general Xenophon. Late one night, as a\r\nyoung man, he was walking through an alleyway between two buildings\r\nnear the Athenian marketplace. Suddenly a mysterious stranger, hidden in\r\nthe shadows, blocked his path with a wooden staff. A voice inquired from\r\nthe darkness, “Do you know where someone should go if he wants to buy\r\ngoods?” Xenophon replied that they were right beside the agora, the finest\r\nmarketplace in the world. There you could buy any goods your heart\r\ndesired: jewelry, food, clothing, and so on. The stranger paused for a\r\nmoment before asking another question: “Where, then, should one go in\r\norder to learn how to become a good person?” Xenophon was dumbstruck.\r\nHe had no idea how to answer. The mysterious figure then lowered his staff,\r\nstepped out of the shadows, and introduced himself as Socrates. Socrates\r\nsaid that they should both try to discover how someone could become a\r\ngood person, because that’s surely more important than knowing where to\r\nbuy all sorts of goods. So Xenophon went with Socrates and became one of\r\nhis closest friends and followers.\r\nI told Poppy that most people believe there are lots of good things—nice\r\nfood, clothes, houses, money, etc.—and lots of bad things in life, but\r\nSocrates said perhaps they’re all wrong. He wondered if there was only one\r\ngood thing, and if it was inside of us rather than outside. Maybe it was\r\nsomething like wisdom or bravery. Poppy thought for a minute, then, to my\r\nsurprise, she shook her head, saying, “That’s not true, Daddy!” which made\r\nme smile. Then she said something else: “Tell me that story again,” because\r\nshe wanted to continue to think about it. She asked me how Socrates\r\nbecame so wise, and I told her the secret of his wisdom: he asked lots of\r\nquestions about the most important things in life, and then he listened very\r\ncarefully to the answers. So I kept telling stories, and she kept asking lots of\r\nquestions. As I came to realize, these little anecdotes about Socrates did\r\nmuch more than just teach her things. They encouraged her to think for\r\nherself about what it means to live wisely.\r\nOne day, Poppy asked me to write down the stories I was telling her, so I\r\ndid. I made them longer and more detailed, then I read them back to her. I\r\nshared some of them online, via my blog. Telling her these stories and\r\ndiscussing them with her made me realize that this was, in many ways, a\r\nbetter approach to teaching philosophy as a way of life. It allowed us to\r\nconsider the example set by famous philosophers and whether or not they\r\nprovide good role models. I began to think that a book that taught Stoic\r\nprinciples through real stories about its ancient practitioners might prove\r\nhelpful not just to my little girl but to other people as well.\r\nNext, I asked myself who was the best candidate to use as a Stoic role\r\nmodel, about whom I could tell stories that would bring the philosophy to\r\nlife and put flesh on its bones. The obvious answer was Marcus Aurelius.\r\nWe know very little about the lives of most ancient philosophers, but\r\nMarcus was a Roman emperor, so far more evidence survives about his life\r\nand character. One of the few surviving Stoic texts consists of his personal\r\nnotes to himself about his contemplative practices, known today as The\r\nMeditations. Marcus begins The Meditations with a chapter written in a\r\ncompletely different style from the rest of the book: a catalogue of the\r\nvirtues, the traits he most admired in his family and teachers. He lists about\r\nsixteen people in all. It seems he also believed the best way to begin\r\nstudying Stoic philosophy was to look at living examples of the virtues. I\r\nthink it makes sense to view Marcus’s life as an example of Stoicism in the\r\nsame way that he viewed the lives of his own Stoic teachers.\r\nThe following chapters are all based upon a careful reading of history.\r\nAlthough I’ve drawn on a wide range of sources, we learn about Marcus’s\r\nlife and character mainly from the Roman historical accounts in Cassius\r\nDio, Herodian, and the Historia Augusta, as well as from Marcus’s own\r\nwords in The Meditations. Sometimes I’ve added minor details or pieces of\r\ndialogue to flesh out the story, but this is how, based on the available\r\nevidence, I imagine the events of Marcus’s life to have unfolded.\r\nThe final chapter of this book is written in a different style, resembling a\r\nguided meditation. It’s closely based on ideas presented in The Meditations\r\nof Marcus Aurelius, although I’ve paraphrased his words to turn them into a\r\nlonger account that’s deliberately intended to evoke mental imagery and a\r\nmore elaborate contemplative experience. I’ve also included a few sayings\r\nand ideas derived from other Stoic authors. I gave it the form of an internal\r\nmonologue or fantasy because I felt that was a good way to present the\r\nStoic contemplation of death and the “view from above.”\r\nThis entire book is designed to help you follow Marcus in acquiring\r\nStoic strength of mind and eventually a more profound sense of fulfillment.\r\nYou’ll find that I’ve combined Stoicism with elements of CBT in many\r\nplaces, which as we’ve seen is only natural because CBT was inspired by\r\nStoicism and they have some fundamental things in common. So you’ll\r\nnotice that I refer to modern therapeutic ideas like “cognitive distancing,”\r\nwhich is the ability to distinguish our thoughts from external reality, and\r\n“functional analysis,” which is evaluating the consequences of different\r\ncourses of action. CBT is a short-term therapy, a remedial approach to\r\nmental health issues like anxiety and depression. Everyone knows that\r\nprevention is better than cure. Techniques and concepts from CBT have\r\nbeen adapted for use in resilience building, to reduce the risk of developing\r\nserious emotional problems in the future. However, I believe that for many\r\npeople a combination of Stoic philosophy and CBT may be even more\r\nsuited for use as a long-term preventive approach. When we take it on as a\r\nphilosophy of life, with daily practice, we have the opportunity to learn\r\ngreater emotional resilience, strength of character, and moral integrity.\r\nThat’s what this book is really about.\r\nThe Stoics can teach you how to find a sense of purpose in life, how to\r\nface adversity, how to conquer anger within yourself, moderate your\r\ndesires, experience healthy sources of joy, endure pain and illness patiently\r\nand with dignity, exhibit courage in the face of your anxieties, cope with\r\nloss, and perhaps even confront your own mortality while remaining as\r\nunperturbed as Socrates. Marcus Aurelius faced colossal challenges during\r\nhis reign as emperor of Rome. The Meditations provides a window into his\r\nsoul, allowing us to see how he guided himself through it all. Indeed, I\r\nwould invite you, as a reader, to put effort into reading this book in a special\r\nway, to try and place yourself in Marcus’s shoes and look at life through his\r\neyes, through the lens of his philosophy. Let’s see if we can accompany him\r\non the journey he made as he transformed himself, day by day, into a fully-\r\nfledged Stoic. Fate permitting, more people may be able to apply the\r\nwisdom of Stoicism to the real challenges and everyday problems of\r\nmodern living. However, that change won’t leap off the page. It only comes\r\nby making a firm decision, here and now, to begin putting ideas like these\r\ninto practice. As Marcus wrote to himself,"
